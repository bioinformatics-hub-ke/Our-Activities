# RNASeq

# RNASeq

RNA sequencing (RNASeq) is a powerful and widely used technique for studying **gene expression** and **transcriptome profiling**. It involves sequencing the RNA molecules present in a biological sample, allowing researchers to identify and quantify the RNA transcripts that are present. RNASeq can be used to investigate a range of biological questions, including identifying differentially expressed genes, characterizing alternative splicing events, and detecting novel transcripts.

One of the major advantages of RNASeq is its ability to detect lowly expressed genes and quantify transcript abundance with high accuracy. This makes it a valuable tool for studying rare cell populations or subtle changes in gene expression. RNASeq can also be used to study non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which have been implicated in a range of biological processes.

RNASeq has become increasingly accessible and affordable in recent years, with a range of commercial and open-source software tools available for analysis. However, RNASeq data analysis can be complex, and requires careful consideration of experimental design, normalization methods, and statistical analysis. Multiple factors affect the tools chosen to carry out analysis, and the workings of these tools have to be well understood to select the best one to carry out analysis. This tool hub will focus on the steps of RNASeq analysis, focusing on the tools available for each step, and the commands to run the steps.

## Datasets

We will use a public dataset from the [Galaxy RNASeq]( https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html) tutorial. We use the subsampled data for our steps, but the large datasets are also available for use. The datasets are in fastqsanger format, which is similar to fastq format

```bash
## You can use wget or curl to get the datasets. Or a for loop

```

## Steps

### 1. Quality control and Trimming

This step involves removing errors introduced during the sequencing process. Different sequence platforms may cause different errors. Trimming is also necessary where adapters are present, and the reads are longer than the fragments sequenced. 

Your input at this point is fastq or fasta reads, and in most cases paired-end reads (_1.fastq and _2 .fastq in our case). The output of the fastqc or multiqc steps are reports that guide on the type of trimming to be done. These two tools are relatively ‘lightweight’ in terms of computational resources, and can run on a local PC.  

- FastQC - Check out the documentation here:  https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC
- MultiQC - MultiQC can aggregate reports of multiple samples: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC

The adapter trimming comes after checking the quality of the sequences. 

- Cutadapt - [https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- TrimGalore - https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore

Another quality check is conducted using FastQC or multiQC tools to check if the quality has improved. 

Each of these tools have man pages to guide their installation and use. Here are the basic commands of the tools:

* Quality Control
  
```bash
## Fastqc basic syntax
fastqc input.fastq

# To run quality check on all our sample datasets use wildcards(*) to select all files ending with .fastqsanger
fastqc ./*.fastqsanger

## Multiqc basic syntax
multiqc [directory contain the fastq html reports]

#If the reports are in the current working directory use
multiqc .
```
* Sample quality plot generated by multiqc

![fastqc_per_base_sequence_quality_plot (4)](https://github.com/Parcelli/Our-Activities/assets/85280870/40a98584-e300-46ee-94b3-be527594e9c4)

* Trimming

**Cutadapt** trims  adapter sequences, primers,and any unwanted sequence from your fastq data.

```
#Cutadapt basic syntax
cutadapt -a AACCGGTT -o output.fastq input.fastq
#The sample data used doesn't have adapters.But if the would contain adapters we would run cutadapt as follows

cutadapt -a AACCGGTT -o GSM461177_1_trimmed.fastqsanger GSM461177_1_subsampled.fastqsanger

#-a - sequence of adapter. Replace the AACCGGTT with the adapter sequence in your data
#-o  the output for trimmed reads
```

**TrimGalore** is a perl wrapper around Cutadapt and FastQC.
```
#Basic trimgalore syntax
trim_galore [options] <filename(s)>

#Trimgalore run on our sample dataset
trim_galore \
--paired GSM461177_1_subsampled.fastqsanger  GSM461177_2_subsampled.fastqsanger \
--quality 30 \
--fastqc \
--nextera \
--output_dir results/clean_reads

#--paired - indicates trimming to performed on paired-end data
#--quality - trim low quality ends from reads
#--nextera - type of adapter sequence. If need be replace with 
#--output_dir - all outputs will be written to this directory

```




### 2. Mapping

Post-sequencing we get sequences ,but we do not know there genomic positions. We need to find the position of each gene on the organisms genome. To do this we ‘map’ or align the reads to the reference genome, if the genome exists.Multiple tools have been designed to do mapping and can be sample specific.These step is usually computationally intensive and in most cases fails on local computers. Cloud computing or running the analysis in a cluster might be a solution if analysis fails on a local PC. 

The input of these tools are a reference genome & FASTA/Q reads and the output is SAM/BAM files. Some common tools include:

- Bowtie2 - https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie2
- SOAP - [http://gaow.github.io/genetic-analysis-software/s/soap/](http://gaow.github.io/genetic-analysis-software/s/soap/)
- STAR - https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR
- HISAT - https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/hisat2
- TopHat -https://github.com/infphilo/tophat

**Bowtie2**

Bowtie2 is a popular alignment tool in bioinformatics written by [Ben Langmead](https://github.com/BenLangmead) at Johns Hopkins University in C++.
It is designed to be fast and memory efficient. Bowtie2 is known to be good at aligning relatively long genomes for example,human genome.Before performing alignment,Bowtie2 builds an index of reference genome. The index allows for quick retrieval of reference sequences during alignment. 
Bowtie2 uses Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithmn to align reads to the reference genome.Bowtie2 offers both local alignment and end to end alignment mode.To learn more on difference between local alignment and end to end alignment check bowtie github [repo](https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie2/blob/521c3230af6c068d7d9f68264db0f01cfb5f0cbb/MANUAL.markdown).

* Installation
  
Bowtie2 can be installed via various package managers. To install using [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bowtie2) use: 

```
conda install -c bioconda bowtie2
```

* Alignment using Bowtie2

**STAR**

STAR Aligner(Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference)

STAR is a splice aware aligner designed to specifically address many of the challenges of RNA-seq data.It shows high accuracy and mapping speed. Alignment in STAR involves two steps;

* Installation using bioconda
  
```
conda install -c bioconda star
```
*Creating genome index

```
STAR --runMode genomeGenerate \
--genomeDir ./starr #path to store genome indices\
--genomeFastaFiles VectorBase-53_AgambiaePEST_Genome.fasta \
--sjdbGTFfile VectorBase-53_AgambiaePEST.gff \
--sjdbOverhang 99 #readlength-1 --sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript gene

#You can specify number of threads using --runThreadN 6  # number of threads
```
* Mapping reads to the genome

```
mkdir alignments
for i in $(cat SraAcclist.txt);
do
    STAR --genomeDir starr \
    --readFilesIn  ${i}_1.fastq.gz ${i}_2.fastq.gz\
    --readFilesCommand zcat  \
    --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
    --quantMode GeneCounts \
    --outFileNamePrefix alignments/${i}
done
#zcat decompress the files
```

**HISAT2**

hisat2 is a fast and sensitive splice-aware aligner that compresses the genome using an indexing scheme to reduce the amount of space needed to store the genome. This also makes the genome quick to search, using a whole-genome index.We use samtools to convert the output file from mapping to bam format and to index the bam files.Indexing creates a searchable index of sorted bam files required in some programs. 

* Installing Hisat2 using bioconda

```
conda install -c bioconda hisat2
```

* Mapping
  
It is important to note that hisat2 requires an **unzipped reference genome** for building an index.

```
#Unzip reference genome
gzip -d Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.32.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

#Build index
mkdir hisat-map
hisat2-build -p25 ./references/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.32.dna.toplevel.fa ./hisat-map/Drosophila_melanogaster.idx

#Run hisat2 using indexed reference

mkdir Alignment_hisat
hisat2 -x ./hisat-map/Drosophila_melanogaster.idx \
-1 GSM461177_1_subsampled.fastqsanger \
-2 GSM461177_2_subsampled.fastqsanger \
-S GSM461177_hisat.sam \

#-X prefix for index files
#-S sam output

#Converting sam to bam files since sam files are quite huge

samtools view -Sb GSM461177_hisat.sam | samtools sort  > GSM461177_hisat_sorted.bam
samtools index GSM461177_hisat_sorted.bam
rm GSM461177_hisat.sam 
done

### 3. Analysis of the deferentially expressed genes

This step shows how genes exhibit notable differences in expression levels between various conditions or experimental groups.
Some of the important aspects of this step include:
  - Understanding biological processes, like molecular mechanisms, that drive such differences between conditions
  - Biomarker discovery, which could be genes having a unique association  with a particular condition or disease
  - Prioritizing genes for further functional analysis such as gene ontology, pathway analysis, or network analysis
  
There are several tools used in doing differential gene expression analysis. The choice of the tool will depend on the study design, sample size, data distribution, and specific analysis requirements.
The following are some common tools used in this step. Primarily, the input to these tools is the RNASeq read count data, and most tools are R package tools;
